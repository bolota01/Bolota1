For use with Menyoo PC. (https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/menyoo-pc-sp)

This map will not load with Map Editor. It will not load on pirated versions of the game. You must have
the latest version of Menyoo and the latest GTA Online patch.

This map is an add-on for Menyoo's Yacht Builder feature. It adds details from the story mode and heist 
yacht that the GTA Online yachts don't have.

INSTALLATION:

Once you've installed Menyoo you'll have a "Menyoostuff" folder in your game directory. 

Go to that, then drop the xml files in your Spooner folder.

IN GAME:
Go to 
Object Spooner > Manage Saved Files

Select the map for the yacht location you want and select Load Placements.

Then, go to Teleports > Yachts and build a custom yacht at the destination you selected (for instance, if you
loaded "Party Yacht (Clean) - Mount Gordo 3," then select "Mount Gordo" and position "3").

Once you do this, you'll be teleported to your yacht and all the extra furniture/interior teleports
will be in place.

You can load this after building your yacht but it will cause the yacht to revert to its default paint job.
